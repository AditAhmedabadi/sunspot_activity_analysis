# sunspot_activity_analysis
Analysis of sunspot activity from 1749 and analyzing the time series sequence model

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection.

It is observed that the pattern is being repeated periodically at an approximate period of 11 years. Peak activity observed in between the 11 year cycle for every period

So we can conclude that regarding sunspot activity, there is an 11 year old cycle
